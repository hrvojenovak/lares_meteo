# LARES meteorological dataset

A dataset of meteorological data provided by the Laboratory for Renewable Energy Systems ([LARES](https://www.lares.fer.hr/)), University of Zagreb, Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing (UNIZG-FER). The data is lightly processed and provided through a collection of CSV files depending on the source of the data. For access to raw, unprocessed, data please contact us at [hrvoje.novak@fer.hr](hrvoje.novak@fer.hr).

## Data

The dataset consists of:
- meteorological measurements from:
  - LARES meteo station located at the top of the UNIZG-FER scyscrapper building,
  - [Croatian Meteorological and Hydrological Service, DHMZ](https://meteo.hr/index_en.php) meteorological station located at Grič, Zagreb,
- weather forecasts provided by the [Croatian Meteorological and Hydrological Service, DHMZ](https://meteo.hr/index_en.php),
- open-source weather forecasts provided by the [Open Weather Service](https://openweathermap.org/),
- open-source weather forecasts provided by the [Open-Meteo Service](https://open-meteo.com/).

### Meteorological measurements

<details>
  <summary>LARES measurements</summary>
LARES weather measurements are collected from the meteorological station located at the top of the UNIZG-FER scyscrapper building (geographical data: 45.801460°, 15.971130°, 55m). Additional solar irradiance measurements are provided by the Kipp & Zonen SOLYS2 sun tracker and corresponding pyrano- and pyrheliometers.

The data consists of:
- timestamp [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS]
- air temperature [°C]
- air humidity [%]
- air pressure [mbar]
- global horizontal irradiance [W/m2]
- direct normal irradiance [W/m2]
- diffuse horizontal irradiance [W/m2]

The data is provided in an minutely resolution, marked at the beggining of the interval, in the UTC timezone, for the period from 2018-04-17 to 2023-03-02

<details>
  <summary>DHMZ measurements</summary>
DHMZ weather measurements are collected from the [Grič, Zagreb meteorological station](https://www.neverin.hr/en/station/zagreb-gric/) (geographical data: 45.814000°, 15.972000°, 157m) and are included into the overall dataset due to the available precipitation measurements (not collected with the LARES meteo station).

The data consists of:
- timestamp [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS]
- precipitation [mm]
- duration [min]

The data is provided in hourly resolution, marked at the beggining of the interval, in the UTC timezone, with the 'duration' column indicating the overall duration of the precipitation within the one-hour interval, for the period from 2017-01-01 to 2021-12-31.

### Weather forecasts
<details>
  <summary>DHMZ weather forecasts</summary>
DHMZ weather forecasts are generated by the ALADIN-2 model for the geographical location of the UNIZG-FER skyscrapper.

The data consists of:
- id
- weather_predictor_id
- weather_prediction_timestamp [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS]
- weather_prediction_start_timestamp [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS]
- weather_prediction_temperature_at_2m
- weather_prediction_dew_point_at_2m
- weather_prediction_relative_humidity_at_2m
- weather_prediction_mean_wind_speed_at_10m 
- weather_prediction_wind_direction_at_10m
- weather_prediction_wind_gust_at_10m
- weather_prediction_mean_wind_speed_at_bldg_top
- weather_prediction_wind_direction_at_bldg_top
- weather_prediction_mean_sea_level_pressure
- weather_prediction_total_cloud_coverage
- weather_prediction_high_cloud_coverage
- weather_prediction_low_cloud_coverage
- weather_prediction_mean_cloud_coverage
- weather_prediction_total_precipitation
- weather_prediction_total_snow
- weather_prediction_direct_solar_irradiance
- weather_prediction_diffuse_solar_irradiance
- weather_prediction_total_solar_irradiance
- weather_prediction_variance_of_the_2m_temperature
- weather_prediction_variance_of_direct_solar_irradiance
- weather_prediction_variance_of_diffuse_solar_irradiance
- weather_prediction_variance_of_total_irradiance

The forecasts are generated 4 times a day at 00:00, 06:00, 12:00 and 18:00, for the period of next 74 hours at an hourly resolution. Due to the large numerical demands of the ALADIN model forecast generation the forecasts are made available with a time lag from 2-4 hours where the 'weather_prediction_timestamp' marks the timestamp of data being made available and the 'weather_prediction_start_timestamp' marks the timestamp of actual forecasted data start. All the forecasted meteorological variables are provided in arrays of 74 variables.
